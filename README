We release anatomical fiducial (AFID) annotions on a subset of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies. 

This subset consists of 30 subjects (age: 58.0 Â± 17.9 years; range: 25-91; 17 female and 23 male) selected from the publicly available Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1) database and imaged at 3-T. The subjects were cognitively intact (Mini-Mental State Examination = 30), and the MRI scans were specifically chosen to be challenging (areas with more complex anatomy and asymmetries).

A total of 3 AFIDs protocol applications (2,880 fiducials) were performed as part of the AFIDs-OASIS30 dataset.

Neuroimaging data were provided by OASIS-1: Cross-Sectional: Principal Investigators: D. Marcus, R, Buckner, J, Csernansky J. Morris; P50 AG05681, P01 AG03991, P01 AG026276, R01 AG021910, P20 MH071616, U24 RR021382
